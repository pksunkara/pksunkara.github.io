      <description>I have recently started tinkering with the Go programming language and I am impressed by its potential.
Go is better than some of the major programming languages at many tasks like concurrency, run time, memory, etc. In my opinion, its ease of deployment ranks high on that list. Everything gets compiled into a single binary and it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of uploading it.
I have used Go for my recent project Alpaca which given a web api, generates client libraries in ruby, python, node and php.</description>

      <description>Every web application requires configuration management. Providing a configuration manager is one of important tasks of any web framework.
Rails does it by asking the user to edit yaml files and a few ruby files. Some node.js frameworks achieve this by using JSON files. In this post, I will present an idea on how the configuration management system should ideally work.
Two years ago, during this time Heroku published a website detailing a concept called The Twelve-Factor App.</description>
