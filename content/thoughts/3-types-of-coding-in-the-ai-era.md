LLMs have landed, and "coding" has split. Hereâ€™s the lowdown:

## Vibe Coding

You've heard of it. [Andrej Karpathy named it](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383), [Simon Willison explained it](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/19/vibe-coding/). Basically, you tell an AI what you want, it writes the code.

Probably used by:

* Beginners & no-coders.
* Anyone on quick or throwaway projects.

> If a colleague reviews the code in a GitHub PR, is it still vibe-coded? I'd say **no**, it's moved beyond just a vibe at that point. What do you think?

## Artisanal Coding

The old-school way: writing code by hand. Maybe with help from deterministic tools like [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol)s, linters or generators. It's you meticulously building it.

Probably used by:

* Beginners learning the ropes.
* Coding purists and enthusiasts who love the craft.
* Projects needing high precision or security.

## Neo Coding

The sweet spot. You code, but LLMs help with autocompletions and generation via chat or local agents.

You're still designing, reviewing, and debugging, but faster. Think a carpenter with a nail gun: still skilled, still in charge, just way more efficient. You're using AI as a power tool, not handing over the reins.

> Would this be the new "coding"?
